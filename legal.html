                <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
                <p>Welcome to La Maison. By accessing our website and participating in our draws, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully. This website is for demonstration purposes only; no real transactions or draws are conducted.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
                <p>Participants must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in their jurisdiction, whichever is greater. This draw is open to participants worldwide, subject to compliance with local laws and regulations regarding online prize competitions. It is the participant's responsibility to ensure their participation is legal in their country of residence.</p>
                
                <h3>2. How to Enter</h3>
                <p>To enter a draw, you must select an entry package, provide the required personal information (including your full name, email address, and phone number), and complete the purchase process. Each purchase grants a specific number of entries into the draw for the advertised prize. All entries are final and non-refundable.</p>

                <h3>3. The Draw Process</h3>
                <p>Once all available entries for a specific prize are sold, the draw is closed and scheduled. A winner is selected using a third-party, independently verified random number generator to ensure absolute fairness and transparency. The draw process is recorded and may be made public to ensure confidence in the outcome.</p>

                <h3>4. Winner Notification & Prize Claim</h3>
                <p>The winner will be contacted via the email address and phone number provided during entry within 72 hours of the draw. The winner must respond within 7 days to claim their prize and provide valid identification and a shipping address. Failure to respond within the specified timeframe may result in disqualification, and a new winner will be drawn from the remaining entries.</p>

                <h3>5. The Prize</h3>
                <p>The prize is as described on the website. All prizes are guaranteed authentic and will be delivered with original documentation where applicable. La Maison will arrange for fully insured, worldwide shipping to the winner's provided address at no additional cost. The winner is solely responsible for any taxes, customs duties, or import fees that may be applicable in their country of residence.</p>
